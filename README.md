# Deadlock Example in Python

This project demonstrates a basic example of a deadlock in Python using threads and locks. It helps beginners understand how deadlocks occur when multiple threads are competing for resources.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **VS Code (Optional)**: You can use Visual Studio Code for running the code locally. Download it from [Visual Studio Code's official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Running the Code

### Option 1: Use an Online Compiler (Online GDB)

You can run the code directly on Online GDB, a web-based IDE, without needing to install anything locally. Follow these steps:

1. Copy the Python code from the `deadlock_example.py` file.
2. Visit [Online GDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/).
3. Select **Python** from the language dropdown on the left.
4. Paste the code into the editor.
5. Click the "Run" button to execute the code.

### Option 2: Run Locally with Visual Studio Code

1. Install **Python 3.x** on your machine if you haven't already. You can check if Python is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python --version

2. Download and install Visual Studio Code if you don't have it. You can find it here.

3. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code:

 - Open VS Code.
 - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
 - Search for "Python" and install the extension by Microsoft.

4. Clone this repository to your local machine using the terminal:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deadlock-example-python.git
   Or you can manually download the project as a zip file and extract it.

5. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code by going to File > Open Folder... and selecting the project directory.

6. Open the terminal in VS Code by going to Terminal > New Terminal.

7. Run the Python code by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python deadlock_example.py
